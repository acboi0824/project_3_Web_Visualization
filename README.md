Finfing a furry friend can be difficult; you may need a pet that gets along well with children or other animals or is small– the list goes on. Our team understands when you have a large pool to choose from, decision-making can be hard. Thanks to [PetFinder's public access API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/), our team created a randomizer tool to help you find a furry friend that meets your needs, but does not overwhelm you with the burden of looking through thousands of potential pets.
